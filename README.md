This is the origin Pytorch implementation of FDNet in the following paper: 
[FDNet: Focal Decomposed Network for Efficient, Robust and Practical Time Series Forecasting] (Manuscript submitted to KBS).

## Decomposed Forecasting Formula
It is different from existing multi-step and one-step forecasting formulas are illustrated Figure 1. Built upon one-step forecasting formula where forecasting processes of prediction elements are decomposed, decomposed forecasting formula further decomposes feature extraction processes of input elements. Hence, FDNet is composed of basic MLPs to extract local fine-grained feature maps of input sequence and canonical convolutions to stabilize feature extraction processes when handling outliers of input sequences.

## Focal Input Sequence Decomposition
How focal input sequence decomposition works with forecasting networks is depicted in Figure 2. The latest sub-sequence of input sequence has the shortest length but has the most feature extraction layers. When it goes to farther regions, decomposed sub-sequence gets longer and feature map extracted from it gets shallower. Proportions of input sequence comprised by different sub-sequences approximately form a geometric series with common ratio of α. We set α to 0.5 throughout following sections and experiments. In fact, α could be set to other positive numbers which are smaller than one, however these make no difference to the essence of focal decomposition. The number of input sub-sequences divided by focal input sequence decomposition method is a hyper-parameter denoted by *f*. For instance, if input sequence is consecutively splitted into 4 parts by focal decompostion method like Figure 2, then proportions will be \{1/2, 1/4, 1/8, 1/8\}. The latest sub-sequence takes the proportion of 1/8 instead of 1/16 in order to make the sum of proportions be 1. Furthermore, feature extractions of different sub-sequences and projections of them to output prediction sequence are all mutually independent. As a result, focal input sequence decomposition method effectively allocates complexity levels to different input sub-sequence independently according to their temporal distances with prediction sequence. Networks with focal input sequence decomposition method is now able to deal with LSTI problem without gaining considerable parameters and suffering performance drop with prolonging the input sequence length. When combining FDNet with focal input sequence decomposition, decomposed feature extraction layers in Figure 3 will take formats in Figure 2.\par

<b>Figure 3.</b> An overview of the architecture of FDNet. It decomposes feature extraction processes of different input elements and different variates. Its main components are N decomposed feature extractor layers (blue trapezoid), each containing four 2D convolutional layers. Weight Normalization, Gelu activation and res-connection are combined with each 2D convolutional layer.
